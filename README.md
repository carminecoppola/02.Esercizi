# Programming-III

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing the exercises completed during the Programming 3 course at Parthenope University in Naples. This repository was created solely for educational purposes and includes exercises related to the BanckAccount concept, along with various variations, as well as other related exercises.

# BanckAccount Exercises

The BanckAccount folder contains the basic implementation of the BanckAccount concept, which includes deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking operations. A BanckAccountTest.java test file has also been included to verify the correct functioning of the implementation.

# Other Exercises

The AltriEsercizi folder contains additional exercises that are not directly related to the BanckAccount concept but still cover topics covered in the Programming 3 course. Each exercise has its own .java source file and the associated test file.
